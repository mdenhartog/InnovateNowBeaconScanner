# InnovateNow Indoor Tracker
The InnovateNow Indoor Tracker is capable of tracking iBeacons and iTags. In combination with a fixed or live GPS location and current location temperature, humidity and air pressure it sents the data via Wifi through the InnovateNowAPI to the available dashboards so a company is able to see how things can be optimized in the processes.

The InnovateNow Indoor Tracker uses the hardware of www.pycom.io. The Indoor Tracker is tested with the following configurations using Pycom WiPy or LoPy4.

- Pycom Expansion board in combination with Ublox NEO-6M GPS and BME280 for measuring temperature, humidity and barometric pressure
